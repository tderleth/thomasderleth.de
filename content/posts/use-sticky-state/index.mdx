Nowadays, I use React function components and the hooks API a lot. One common use case that naturally arises is to keep React state and localStorage in sync. Though we're building client side applications, we still want them to work when the user refreshes the page or comes back to the application after some time.

This is where the localStorage comes in that let's us store some React state and re-hydrate it into our application on page laod. To avoid repeating ourselfs with localStorage code, we can create a custom hook that lets us use localStorage as a React state store. The respective interface should look the same as a regulare react  `useState` hook, a tuple of the current state and a dispatch function that lets us update the state.

```tsx
import { Dispatch, SetStateAction } from 'react';

type PersistedState<T> = [T, Dispatch<SetStateAction<T>>];

export { PersistedState };
```

Inside our custom hook, we can use the `useState` hook to create a state store that either returns the value from the localStorage or the default value. We can then use the `useEffect` hook to update the localStorage item when the state changes:

```tsx
import { Dispatch, SetStateAction, useEffect, useState } from 'react';

type PersistedState<T> = [T, Dispatch<SetStateAction<T>>];

function usePersistedState<T>(defaultValue: T, key: string): PersistedState<T> {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<T>(() => {
    const value = window.localStorage.getItem(key);

    return value ? (JSON.parse(value) as T) : defaultValue;
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  }, [key, value]);

  return [value, setValue];
}

export { usePersistedState };
```

The usePersistedState hook works like a regular `useState` hook, except it persists to and restores the state from a localStorage item. On the first render, the hook will try to restore the state from localStorage. If there is no value in localStorage, the hook will return the default value.

You might noticed the typescript cast in the return call (`JSON.parse(value) as T`), which can lead to potential schema issues. Let's take this example:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { usePersistedState } from '.';

interface User {
  name: string
}

const App = () => {
  const [user] = usePersistedState<User>({ name: 'John' }, 'user');

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{user.name}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export { App };
```

Now we want to change the user interface to something like:

```ts
interface User {
  firstname: string;
  lastname: string;
}
```

The item we stored in a user's localStorage and our React state don't follow the same schema anymore. There might be users out there that have an outdated item in their localStorage persisted. This will very likely lead to a runtime error at least to unintended behavior. One way to avoid this is to use some runtime type system like io-ts to validate schema correctnes. The following example shows how to use io-ts to validate our new schema:

```tsx
import * as t from 'io-ts'
import React from 'react';
import { usePersistedState } from '.';
import { isRight } from 'fp-ts/lib/Either'

const tUser = t.type({
  firstname: t.string,
  lastname: t.string
})

type User = t.TypeOf<typeof tUser>

const App = () => {
  const [user] = usePersistedState<User>({ firstname: 'John', lastname: 'Doe' }, 'user');

  return isRight(tUser.decode(user)) ? (
      <div>
        <p>{user.name}</p>
      </div>
    ) : (
      <div>
        <p>Invalid user schema</p>
      </div>
    );
  }

export { App };
```

Recap: Custom Hooks to keep React state and localStorage in sync are realy a great, thought they come with one caveat of schema validation.
