Git is more than just simple version control. Here are a few small tricks on how you can use your version control even better!

##### 1. Step through each change!

```noLineNumbers
git add -p
```

Already wrote multiple changes to the same file, but only wanted to commit one of the changes? Use [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#Documentation/git-add.txt---patch) command to go through your changes (step by step) and decide which of your changes you want to commit and which you don't.

##### 2. Your last five commits as a one-liner

```noLineNumbers
git log -5 --pretty --oneline
```

Look at your last five commits each in a row.

##### 3. How many contributors, how many commits?

```noLineNumbers
git shortlog -sn
```

Returns a list of contributors with the number of their commits to the current repository.

##### 4. Branch States

```noLineNumbers
git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline --simplify-by-decoration
```

Returns you a complete status across all your branches. Since this command is difficult to remember, simply assign an `alias` in your `~/.gitconfig`.

##### 5. How many lines of code did you write today?

```noLineNumbers
git diff --shortstat "@{0 day ago}"
```

Shows you the number of files, insertions, and deletions that you made today.

##### 6. Jump to your last branch

```noLineNumbers
git checkout -
```

As the headline says, you jump to your last branch without specifying its name.

##### 7. "Uncommit" your code

```noLineNumbers
git reset --soft HEAD~{amount_of_commits}
```

Will keep your changes but _uncommit_ your last `{amount_of_commits}` commits.

##### 8. Auto-correct your git commands

```noLineNumbers
git config --global help.autocorrect -1
```

This is for all quick typers who like to write `git satus` instead of `git status`.
