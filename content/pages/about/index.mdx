title: Hello, Iâ€™m Thomas Derleth.

I like to read, hear, talk, think, and write about technologies and products. I love building all kinds of things on the internet.

I live in Berlin, Germany. In 2015, I graduated with a B.Sc. degree in Media and Information Engineering and Design and finished my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Media in late 2017. After my studies, I joined [moovel](https://www.moovel.com/en), an urban mobility company, that aims to make cities smarter. Currently, I am working as a Product Owner and Software Engineer at [Mobimeo](https://mobimeo.com/en/), building microservices with Node.js written in TypeScript and deployed on AWS. My credo is product-driven engineering that solves real-world problems, which helps me to focus on what matters most every day. If you're interested in a more formal _"about"_, you can view my resume over [here](https://thomasderleth.de/files/curriculum-vitae.pdf).

I am always open to new technologies and methods as well as side projects and new challenges that improve my work. Contact me at [thomas.derleth@me.com](mailto:thomas.derleth@me.com).
