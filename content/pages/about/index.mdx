I like to read, hear, talk, think, and write about technologies and products. I love building all kinds of things on the internet.

Based in Stuttgart, Germany, I earned my B.Sc. in Media and Information Engineering and Design in 2015, followed by completing my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Media in late 2017. Post my academic pursuits, I embarked on a journey with [moovel](https://www.moovel.com/en), an urban mobility company committed to make cities smarter. Presently, I serve as an Engineering Lead at [Mobimeo](https://mobimeo.com/en/), specializing in building microservices utilizing Node.js in TypeScript, deployed on AWS.

My approach centers on product-centric engineering aimed at tackling real-world issues. This ethos guides my daily focus, emphasizing solutions that truly matter. For a more formal overview, my resume is accessible [here](https://thomasderleth.de/files/curriculum-vitae.pdf).

I am always open to new technologies and methods as well as side projects and new challenges that improve my work. Feel free to reach out at [thomas.derleth@me.com](mailto:thomas.derleth@me.com).
